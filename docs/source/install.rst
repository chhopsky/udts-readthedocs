.. note:: UDTS has only been tested on Windows 7 and later. It may not work with earlier versions of Windows.

First, :doc:`download </releases>` your preferred version of UDTS and unzip it.

Once UDTS is unzipped, run **udts.exe**. This will create two new folders in that same location: **/logs** and **/streamlabels**.

**/streamlabels** is where UDTS saves the .txt and .png files it creates. You can use these files to build a scene in OBS and other streaming programs.

First, :doc:`download </releases>` your preferred version of UDTS and unzip it.

.. warning:: 
    Depending on your Mac, UDTS may be slow to load. 
    
    **If UDTS asks for permission to access files in your Documents folder, select OK.** UDTS cannot run without the ability to write to Documents.

    If UDTS doesn't run the first time you launch it, try running it a second time.

Once UDTS is unzipped, run **udts.app**. This will create a **udts** folder in your Documents, along with three sub-folders: **/logs**, **/static**, and **/streamlabels**.

**/streamlabels** is where UDTS saves the .txt and .png files it creates. You can use these files to build a scene in OBS and other streaming programs.
